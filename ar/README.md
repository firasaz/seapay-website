# Fragment Component Explanation:
-   ### Structure is as follows:
    1. div wraps everything and applies the style prop
    2. div wraps the common/required elements of every card component (aka. title, description, and image)
    3. div wraps the children of the component in case we wanted a big card component to with more stuff, we can include them inside the component and render them with the component.
